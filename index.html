I think you are a werewolf, and nominate you.

Theoretically, you will soon be able to use this website to:<ul><li>Find out when and where the next Portland Werewolf meetup will be.
<li>Indicate if you will be going, and how many guests you might bring. Space is limited at some venues, so first-come, first-served. At night. When you're a werewolf.
<li>Donate to Al's venmo account for all the time he paid for the room at Lucky Lab.
<li>Recite poetry.
<li>Learn how to play werewolf.</div>
